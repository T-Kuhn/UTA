	// Just a memo
    // Let's get some structure into this.
    // Things we need to do include:
    // - pointing the thing up or downwards & setting the origin to diferent positions
    // depending on the gridpos
    // - making the availableGridPos thing work by adding new positions whenever a triangle is added.

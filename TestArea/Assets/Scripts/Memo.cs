	// Just a memo
    // another thing. I am still wondering about the List thing.
    // Let's image I had a list with all the ChildTriangles

    // when I look for available positions, I make a foreach
    // with this list, or even better use linq to get all the elements which
    // satisfy a certain criteria.

    // In this case, the gridPosition would be saved in each childTriangle.
    // and we could actually make negative gridpositions.

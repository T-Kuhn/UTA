	// Just a memo
    // What did we do so far? And what are the goals?
    // We were able to play around with textures and use blender to some extent
    // we were able to change the background (aka skybox of the game)
    // we got an idea for a certain game effect using triangles
    // next, we could try to make a emission map.

    // we got a goal now.
    // we need to figure out how to set the emission property from inside a
    // script.

    // we found out how to alter that emission thing.
    // we also found out how to debug properly in visual studio
